# Millionaires
Console game based on the game show "Millionaires".

How to run the game (Windows):

You can start the game by oppening project in your IDE and running the "Main" (after selecting JDK as your SDK and compiling) 
but I recommend starting from your computer console (JDK installed required).

STEPS:

1. Download and extract my project.
2. Go to /src folder and copy its full path.
3. Open a cmd console.
4. Type the command: cd your/copied/path (If the console path starts from a different drive than the project is located, you need to change it first.)
5. Type the command: javac Main.java
6. Type the command: java Main

The game should start.
